## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the Hangman game. The aim of the project is to practice Python programming and understand the basics of game development. Through this project, I learned about control flow, functions, and user input handling in Python.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman48.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hangman48
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

## Usage
To play the game, simply run the `hangman.py` script. The computer will randomly select a word, and you will have to guess it by entering one letter at a time. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
